    The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and 
    architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events 
    to meet the entity's objectives.

    evidence: |
      Scope Drift Detection: Denies privilege escalations in real-time; logs all attempts;
      quarantines suspicious identities within 3 seconds. Emits OCSF security event.

  - detection_rule: NHI-005
    evidence: |
      Token Lineage Break Detection: Validates parent_kid vs mint path; automatically
      rotates compromised tokens; emits OCSF authentication event with lineage data.
    mappings:
      mitre_attack: ["T1550.001"]
      pci_dss: ["8.2.3"]

    sla_seconds: 3

  - detection_rule: NHI-003
    evidence: |
      New Region Anomaly: Detects identity access from unexpected geographic regions;
      triggers step-up authentication; logs for security review.
    mappings:
      mitre_attack: ["T1078"]

    automated: true
    sla_seconds: 5

audit_procedures:
  - Quarterly review of detection rule hits and false positive rates
  - Monthly red-team simulation for scope drift and lineage break scenarios
  - Verify median time-to-mitigate (TTM) ≤ 3 seconds for critical detections
  - Validate false positive rate < 5% for all automated controls
  - Annual external penetration test of access control mechanisms
